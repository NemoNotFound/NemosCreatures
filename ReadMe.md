## Features

- Jungle
  - "Venomous Skeleton" spawns instead of "Skeleton". It shoots poisonous arrows and sometimes also drops them when dying.
  - "Venomous Spider" spawns instead of "Spider". It's bites are toxic, so keep distance!
  - "Venomous Zombie" spawns instead of "Zombie". His hands are covered with poison, so don't let him touch you!
  - "Venomous Creeper" spawns instead of "Creeper". Don't let him explode, but if you do, then make sure to not be in the middle of the explosion, because his explosion creates a poisonous cloud!
- Desert
  - "Scorched Skeleton" spawns instead of "Skeleton". It's arrows dries you out and lets you starve to death, so better dodge them!
  - "Sand Spider" spawns instead of "Spider". It's a small spider, but don't let this fool you. Their bites will hurt a lot and make you starve! Oh, and he will dry you out!
  - "Mummy" spawns instead of "Zombie". If I could choose to be punched by a "Mummy" or a "Zombie", I'd choose the zombie everytime! Due to the preservation of it's body, it has 50% more health and 100% more damage, but luckily it gets slowed down by the bandages, so run away!
  - "Scorched Creeper" spawns instead of "Creeper". His explosion spreads particles which will dry you out and make you starve, so better don't let him explode!
- Crimson Forest
  - "Crimson Skeleton". His time in the crimson forest made him learn how to work with fire. He's always equipped with a flame bow and the worst thing is, that the flame's heat increases the arrow's thermal energy and makes it shoot even faster! So get a shield, a splash potion of water or simply run!
- Warped Forest
  - "Warped Skeleton". He definitely spent too much time with endermen. Its arrows won't just shoot, but teleport to you!
- Forests
  - "Wild Boar". Don't get too close, or he might attack you!
