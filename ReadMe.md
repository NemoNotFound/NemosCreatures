# Nemo's Creatures

Nemo's Creatures will bring some new biome specific mobs to Minecraft!
This mod is WIP, so feel free to give me your feedback, suggestions and wishes.
I would appreciate it a lot!

## Features

- Jungle
  - New mob "Venom" spawns instead of Skeleton. "Venom" shoots poisonous arrows and sometimes also drops them when dying. It's a skeleton which lives only in the Jungle.
