# Nemo's Creatures

Nemo's Creatures will bring some new biome specific mobs to Minecraft!
This mod is WIP, so feel free to give me your feedback, suggestions and wishes.
I would appreciate it a lot!

## Features

- Jungle
  - "Venomous Skeleton" spawns instead of "Skeleton". It shoots poisonous arrows and sometimes also drops them when dying.
  - "Venomous Spider" spawns instead of "Spider". It's bites are toxic, so keep distance!
  - "Venomous Zombie" spawns instead of "Zombie". His hands are covered with poison, so don't let him touch you!
  - "Venomous Creeper" spawns instead of "Creeper". Don't let him explode, but if you do, then make sure to not be in the middle of the explosion, because his explosion creates a poisonous cloud!
- Desert
  - "Scorched Skeleton" spawns instead of "Skeleton". It's arrows dries you out and lets you starve to death, so better dodge them!
